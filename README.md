Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my enriching journey through the PwC Virtual Internship focused on data analysis using Power BI. This space serves as a dynamic journal of my exploration into the world of data-driven decision-making.


Taske 1:


In Task 1 of my PwC Virtual Internship, I took on the exciting challenge of crafting a comprehensive Customer Progress Tracking Dashboard using the robust capabilities of Power BI.
This task exemplified my data visualization prowess and commitment to delivering actionable insights.

Using Power BI's intuitive interface, I curated a dashboard that intricately showcased various key performance indicators (KPIs), such as customer engagement rates,
conversion trends, and satisfaction scores. My visualizations ranged from dynamic line charts depicting growth trajectories to interactive pie charts highlighting customer segments.

Task 2:


Dive into an insightful exploration of customer churn trends over a defined timeframe using a comprehensive dataset. The dataset encompasses crucial customer details such as contract types, internet services, monthly charges, and tenure. The main objective is to uncover patterns that shed light on customer behavior and facilitate strategic decision-making for minimizing churn rates.

This analysis aspires to furnish actionable intelligence that guides strategies for customer retention, service enhancement, and overall satisfaction. By comprehending the dynamics of customer churn trends over time, we can proactively address challenges and capitalize on opportunities to cultivate stronger customer relationships.

Task 3:

During my virtual internship, I harnessed Power BI to perform in-depth data analysis, a key driver behind the project's successful completion. 
I began by cleansing and structuring the data, then created interactive visualizations, charts, and tables to explore trends and correlations.
Through KPI definition and advanced analytics, I unveiled hidden insights within the dataset, enhancing my understanding of the subject. 
Building an intuitive dashboard in Power BI consolidated these findings, making them accessible to stakeholders. 
The insights gleaned from the analysis played a pivotal role in informing strategic decisions and recommendations, thereby contributing to the project's 
positive outcome. This experience demonstrated my proficiency in using Power BI as a powerful tool for data exploration, analysis, and effective communication
of insights.
