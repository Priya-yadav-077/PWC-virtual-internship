# PWC-virtual-internship
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my enriching journey through the PwC Virtual Internship focused on data analysis using Power BI. This space serves as a dynamic journal of my exploration into the world of data-driven decision-making.

In Task 1 of my PwC Virtual Internship, I took on the exciting challenge of crafting a comprehensive Customer Progress Tracking Dashboard using the robust capabilities of Power BI.
This task exemplified my data visualization prowess and commitment to delivering actionable insights.

Using Power BI's intuitive interface, I curated a dashboard that intricately showcased various key performance indicators (KPIs), such as customer engagement rates,
conversion trends, and satisfaction scores. My visualizations ranged from dynamic line charts depicting growth trajectories to interactive pie charts highlighting customer segments.
